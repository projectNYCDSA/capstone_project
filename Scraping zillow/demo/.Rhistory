#-Intercept: The log odds of a student getting admitted to a graduate school
#            when they attended a top tier undergraduate school and received a
#            0 on the GRE and a 0 as their GPA is approximately -3.990.
#-GRE: For every additional point a student scores on the GRE, their log odds
#      of being admitted to graduate school increase by approximately 0.002,
#      holding all other variables constant.
#-GPA: For every additional point a student raises their GPA, their log odds of
#      being admitted to graduate school increase by approximately 0.804, holding
#      all other variables constant.
#-Rank: The change in log odds associated with attending an undergraduate school
#       with prestige of rank 2, 3, and 4, as compared to a school with prestige
#       rank 1, is approximately -0.675, -1.340, and -1.552, respectively, holding
#       all other variables constant.
